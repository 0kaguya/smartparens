# Smartparens

Smartparens is modern minor mode for Emacs that *deals with parens pairs and tries to be smart about it*. It is an unification and enhancement effort to combine funcitonality of several existing packages in a single, common and straightforward way (and most of all *compatible*). These packages include [autopair](https://github.com/capitaomorte/autopair), [textmate](http://code.google.com/p/emacs-textmate/), [wrap-region](https://github.com/rejeep/wrap-region), [paredit](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit) and others with similar philosophies. It also adds support for many more features. [Here's][wiki-what] a highlight of some features, for a complete list and detailed documentation look in the [manual][wiki-new].
